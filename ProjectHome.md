## Important notice ##
In most cases, binary packages are sufficient for you.
(Unfortunately compiling Java-M3G and Desktop-M3G by your self is rather complicated)

It contains all what you need.

I tested only on Android 2.2. Sorry I don't know it works or not on other versions.

## Brief description ##
Java-M3G is java bindings for [Desktop-M3G](http://code.google.com/p/desktop-m3g/) which is a native(C++) implementation of M3G.

Yes, Desktop-M3G + Java-M3G = full JSR-184 implementation.

It works on Ubuntu or Android.

These images are captured on Android 2.2 / TOSHIBA Dynabook AZ. It works well.
